            This is a website dedicated for me to test out how well I can use certain elements, such as embedding certain 
            elements from other sites onto another (basically the definition of embedding in the first place).

        <p>
            Country Clicker is a short game made in Code.org.
            It was one of the first projects I ever created in gamelab.
            It was decently popular on the platform before the shared projects page was changed.
            This project inspired me to keep going and learning code, eventually leading to this very website!
            THIS GAME DOES NOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS!

            Retail Simulator is another code.org game made by myself.
            It gets into more advanced coding within the platform.

        <p>
            Eaglercraft is a remake of a popular game. 
            There are 2 versions of the game, one is an older version that seems to have less bugs and more integrated features,
            the other is a newer version that seems to have some bugs.
            It is important to note that they are NOT made by the same person.
